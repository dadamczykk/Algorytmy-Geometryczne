# Computational geometry laboratories
This repository contains implementations of algorithms developed during the Computational geometry course at AGH UST for the 2022/2023 academic year.

## Technologies
The algorithms were implemented in Python 3 using Jupyter Notebook and a simple visualizer based on Matplotlib provided by the academy. This visualizer can be found in the "tools" folder.

## Folder Contents
Each folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file with the implementation of a geometric algorithm and a tool to visualize its performance step by step, allowing the user to see how the algorithm works. There is also a report in Polish that was the assignment for the laboratories. Additionally, there are pictures or animations showing the results of the implemented algorithms (excluding lab1).

## Table of Contents
Here is a list of the algorithms covered during the course:
